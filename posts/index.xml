<p>On my first Jira task, I really struggle to find out <em>magic</em> behind Rails, a lot of class or module not implicitly import to another class, but I can use that class easily. Different with Django, you must import or define anything you plan to use. In Rails as long as your naming conventions follow documentation you can save a few lines of code (except you&rsquo;re using unofficial Rails Gem, you must import class using &lsquo;use&rsquo; command)</p>
<h2 id="handy-built-in-method">Handy Built-in Method</h2>
<h3 id="try-object">try() Object</h3>
<p>Imagine, you don&rsquo;t to worry about how to handle <code>out of index array</code> in Rails, I just found how to handle array with elegance (yes, as you know, I just to know Ruby about 1 week since this post was done I write), just put object <code>try()</code> after that you don&rsquo;t to worry about the possibility of that object being <code>nil</code> and thus raising an exception. See code snip on below:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Disclaimer: <code>try()</code> object is good to implement when you not have much time to validate all return came from other object, this will prevent your code from process break, but this technique is not a replacement for good techniques like validations and default database values.</p>
<h3 id="rails-orm-active-record">Rails ORM: Active Record</h3>
<p>What is ORM?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science
is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems
using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a &ldquo;virtual
object database&rdquo; that can be used from within the programming language. There are
both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping,
although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the other word, ORM modified or retrieved by writing query statements, and it lets you interact with that data as though it was a normal Ruby object.</p>
<p>For example from this query to fetch all data from <code>table</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-mysql" data-lang="mysql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">table</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Active record (ORM in Rails) will wrap that into <code>all()</code> object.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#66d9ef">Table</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>all()
</code></pre></div><h3 id="array-manipulation">Array Manipulation</h3>
<p>Rails have bunched of method to make coding more fun, for manipulate array Rails have  <code>select</code>, <code>each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>reject</code> and <code>reduct</code>. Let&rsquo;s pick one sample to see what make this method so special.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with <a href="https://vercel.com/">Now</a> deployment for a few months. First I thought about Now is magic, with only small configuration (in v2) I can deploy a static website easily and with the latest update, now I can deploy (with default template) any static website without any configuration. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-deploy">How to Deploy</h2>
<p>First thing, you need Vercel account, of course. Next, if you use one of the templates from this <a href="https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples">list</a>, congratulation, you only need execute <code>now</code> from the project root, something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cd my_project
now
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it. For the rest let Now do the work.</p>
<p>After your project has been deployed, you will be provided with a link to the Preview Deployment, this can be shared <strong>immediately</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-cloudflare-with-now">How to Use Cloudflare with Now</h2>
<p>Vercel have internal domain management, so you can directly buy domain inside Vercel dashboard. But if you want to set up domain setting using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so you can set cache or other, this also simple. You just need register some DNS and encryption settings.</p>
<h3 id="add-dns-records">Add DNS Records</h3>
<p>To connecting Cloudflare with Vercel, you need add <code>CNAME</code> record with alias of <code>alias.zeit.co</code> so its traffic proxied through Cloudflare. Next, register domain to Vercel account using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">now domains add your-domain-name.com
</code></pre></div><p>when add the domain success, you will get a verification code for further to fill <code>TXT</code> record with name <code>_now</code>.</p>
<p>After all records has been created, you need to verify domain using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">now domains verify your-domain-name.com
</code></pre></div><h3 id="make-https-works">Make HTTPS Works</h3>
<p>To make https works you need change Cloudflare’s encryption mode to <strong>Full (strict)</strong> and then create page rules to make Enforce HTTPS for this domain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to page &ldquo;Create Page Rule&rdquo;</li>
<li>Add new page rules with configuration like this:<br>
URL: <strong>http://*your-domain-name.com/*</strong><br>
The settings are: <strong>Always Use HTTPS</strong></li>
<li>Save and Deploy</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="make-deploy-automatically">Make Deploy Automatically</h2>
<p>If your project source code hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/">Bitbucket</a>, Vercel have tools to integrating with deployment, so when you push code to the specific branch, Vercel will automatically detect changes and make a deployment. For more information,jump up to <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations">Vercel documentation</a>.</p>

After success deploying, if you set Cloudflare cache to make your website faster I guess you will face issue relate with a cache.</p>
<p>First, if you push or make changes, your website not instantly follow the changes. From my experience that because of cache! So to handle this case we need to purge every time we make a change and Git have a handy feature to make it automatically, they call hooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such
as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a built-in feature - no
need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.<a href="https://githooks.com/">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use this feature you only need to create a shell script and make it executable then put in hooks directory in .git on a project root. So that will be like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">cd my_project/.git/hooks
touch pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
</code></pre></div><p>Inside file <code>pre-commit</code>, we can add shell script to call Cloudflare API like this:</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/muhfajar/2827adc296f5afb23c0f15b9835f881a.js"></script>

<p>As you can see, that have separated config file, to make the script work, we also need to create a configuration file in the user directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">cd ~
touch .cloudflare_config_muhfajar.blog
</code></pre></div><p>And add detail about Cloudflare configuration</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">CF_API_KEY=some-api-key-from-cloudflare
CF_EMAIL=your.email.registered.in.cloudflare@foo.com
CF_ID=cloudflare-zone-id
</code></pre></div><p>To generate an API key in Cloudflare, please refer to this <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create">link</a>. After all complete, now you can deploy and also tell Cloudflare to purge your cache, so your web visitor always gets the latest data.</p>

<p>Since internet access in my apartment is not good enough to make a video call or conference call, so I decide to make my phone as a wifi modem, in the other word is wifi tethering. My mobile carrier is more reliable than apartment wifi, with a term and condition.</p>
<p>The term and condition are like, a good signal is not in all apartment area, that needs a lot of experiment and after multiple parameters to find a better signal, I just need to put my phone in there and don&rsquo;t do anything, and the other condition is, my phone need to placed directly on the floor, that&rsquo;s like a  natural cooling system, with the air conditioner turned on of course. Super cool and all good.</p>
<p>But after a few days, I am facing a new issue. Because I can&rsquo;t use my phone when it transforms into mobile wifi, I often miss text notification and when someone calls me, the connection goes to unstable. This one makes me need a standalone mobile wifi device.</p>

<p>I decide to buy a wifi device from an online store, after some &ldquo;research&rdquo; about what the best and cheapest wifi device I found <strong>4Gee Wifi Mini</strong>. The journey hasn&rsquo;t stopped here. I face a new issue hahaha. I need to check the battery every single hour. Because I don&rsquo;t want to break my mobile wifi battery too soon, so I not connect it to the power adapter when the power level before reached 10%. Because I&rsquo;m too lazy to open <em>http://192.168.1.1/</em> (4Gee Wifi Mini web dashboard) every single hour to check battery level, so I make a python script to call that battery status and notify me when the battery is low or full. The result is now I know when I need to plug in the AC adapter or disconnect the AC adapter.</p>
<p>So far so good, all going well, my internet connection is more stable. If you want to see or have the same problem and want to use my <strong>4Gee Wifi Mini</strong> battery watcher script, you can download at my <a href="https://github.com/muhfajar/4gee-wifi-battery-watcher">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>Long short story, I had read the documentation and try the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/">project tutorial</a> and surprisingly, what the motto says I think is all true. I only need to write a model and register to the admin view, and voila, create, update, read, and delete for the related a model complete with the dashboard, and the login page is ready to use. Oh, with the migration file as well. Quite promising isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<p>In my journey to dig deeper with Django, I&rsquo;m contributing the open-source project to find out how the others using this framework.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-django-project">The First Django Project</h2>
<p>One day my friend comes to me and tells he has a freelance project. The project is creating API for mobile application with a tight deadline. I thought of using Laravel instead of Django because I&rsquo;m more familiar with that and from my portfolio, I have pretty much project using Laravel.</p>
<p>When kick-off meeting, I try to breakdown all requirement and all possibilities if I&rsquo;m using Laravel but when the timeline came in, I thought this would nearly impossible if I&rsquo;m creating API and the dashboard at the same time. For only one month of working. As you know, at the moment I still work at a software house company, this means I have a limited time to working.</p>
<p>So, I decide to use Django instead of Laravel, even I never use it in production level. That will be my first project using Django.</p>
<h4 id="fingers-crossed">*fingers crossed*</h4>
<p>All good until the requirement and the other has changed time by time, and I still can follow the timeline, In other words, Django works well with a tight deadline, but not with the project requirement. I think how sophisticated a framework if the project timeline, and the requirements from the beginning are not clear enough, that all will not be getting done on time.</p>
<p>The other project is an internal tool for the attendance system. The attendance system itself using RFID technology, and I&rsquo;m using Django as a bridge from Raspberry to the existing attendance system. <a href="https://github.com/muhfajar/sshub-middleware">This project</a> only spends two days working from scratch.</p>
<p>After quite a lot of projects using Django, I&rsquo;m more confident using it. Because from the one-month timeline, using Django can cut up to one week, it&rsquo;s something right?</p>

<p>And the last thing, fun fact when using this framework, I&rsquo;m using Django for my assignment test when joining Loket. I have one week to complete the test, but I can finish it for less than a day.</p>
