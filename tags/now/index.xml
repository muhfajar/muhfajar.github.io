First I thought about Now is magic, with only small configuration (in v2) I can deploy a static website easily and with the latest update, now I can deploy (with default template) any static website without any configuration. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
How to Deploy First thing, you need Vercel account, of course.</description></item></channel></rss>
