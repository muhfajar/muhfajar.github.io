First I thought about Now is magic, with only small configuration (in v2) I can deploy a static website easily and with the latest update, now I can deploy (with default template) any static website without any configuration. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
How to Deploy First thing, you need Vercel account, of course.</description></item><item><title>Playing in Ruby Mine</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/playing-in-ruby-mine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 12:52:59 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/playing-in-ruby-mine/</guid><description>I started as Ruby dev in my new job, previously I worked as PHP and Python dev and I found Ruby is slightly different sometimes especially with PHP. First time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional word every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end For framework Ruby have Rails (not only Rails actually, many framework out there) and when I came to my new job, I have only 3 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I am learning by doing after my quick learn from digging up Ruby and Rails documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
