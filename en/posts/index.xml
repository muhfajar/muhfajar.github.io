<p>On my first Jira task, I really struggling to find out <em>magic</em> behind Rails, a lot of class didn&rsquo;t import or extend to another class but I can use that class easily. Different with Django, you must import or define anything you plan to use. In Rails as long as your naming conventions follow documentation you can save a few lines of code (except you&rsquo;re using unofficial Rails Gem, you must import class using &lsquo;use&rsquo; command)</p>
