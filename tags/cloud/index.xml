After success deploying, if you set Cloudflare cache to make your website faster I guess you will face issue relate with a cache.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Now deployment for a few months.

That&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
How to Deploy First thing, you need Vercel account, of course.</description></item></channel></rss>
