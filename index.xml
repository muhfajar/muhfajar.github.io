I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/migrate-to-hugo-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2014 17:32:59 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/migrate-to-hugo-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>Django: The Side Project Best Friend</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/django-the-side-project-best-friend/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:43:09 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/django-the-side-project-best-friend/</guid><description>Ever you heard about Django before? If not, you are like me in early 2016, the year when I first found this gem. I was wondering about a Django since the website says &amp;ldquo;The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.&amp;rdquo; (djangoproject.com). Me as a person who knows nothing about Django when first read that is like, &amp;ldquo;really? I must learn this to find out this framework is really for perfectionists with deadlines or just a gimmick&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/modern-problems-require-modern-solutions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 15:55:14 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/modern-problems-require-modern-solutions/</guid><description>Recently I posted about my experience with the longest work from home (posted in Bahasa) I ever had so far. The biggest challenge about work from home on the internet era is an internet connection itself. I often got a bad connection in the middle of the meeting, that not good especially I&amp;rsquo;m the host in a meeting, not only once but &amp;ldquo;daily standup meeting&amp;rdquo;.
