First time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional word every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end For framework Ruby have Rails (not only Rails actually, many framework out there) and when I came to my new job, I have only 3 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I am learning by doing after my quick learn from digging up Ruby and Rails documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
