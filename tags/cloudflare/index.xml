After success deploying, if you set Cloudflare cache to make your website faster I guess you will face issues related to a cache.
First, if you push or make changes, your website does not instantly follow the changes. From my experience that is because of cache!</description></item><item><title>Deploying Now with Cloudflare</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2019/10/deploying-now-with-cloudflare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 08:43:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2019/10/deploying-now-with-cloudflare/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Now deployment for a few months. First I thought about Now is magic, with only a small configuration (in v2) I can deploy a static website easily, now I can deploy (with default template) any static website without any configuration. That&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
How to Deploy First thing, you need a Vercel account, of course. Next, if you use one of the templates from this list, congratulation, you only need to execute now from the project root, something like this.</description></item></channel></rss>
