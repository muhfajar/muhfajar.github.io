How to Deploy First thing, you need Vercel account, of course.</description></item><item><title>Playing in Ruby Mine</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2018/01/playing-in-ruby-mine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 12:52:59 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2018/01/playing-in-ruby-mine/</guid><description>I started as Ruby dev in my new job, previously I worked as PHP and Python dev and I found Ruby is slightly different sometimes especially with PHP.
