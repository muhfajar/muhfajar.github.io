      <description>I started as Ruby dev in my new job, previously I worked as PHP and Python dev and I found Ruby is slightly different sometimes especially with PHP. First time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional word every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end Okay that for syntax, for framework Ruby have Rails (not only Rails, many framework out there) and when I came to my new job, I have 4 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I learning by doing after my quick learn from Ruby and also Rails documentation.</description>
