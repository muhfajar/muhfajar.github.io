I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/migrate-to-hugo-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/migrate-to-hugo-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>Settings</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/settings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 11:24:21 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/settings/</guid><description> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Use Bahasa &amp;nbsp; Change font face &amp;nbsp; Increase font size &amp;nbsp; Decrease font size const buttonTextDark = 'Toggle theme to light'; const buttonTextLight = 'Toggle theme to dark';</description></item><item><title>Chat</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/chat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:30:21 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/chat/</guid><description>Hello there, want to chat with stranger within this site, just open inspect and see console.

First time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional word every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end Okay for syntax, for framework Ruby have Rails (not only Rails actually, many framework out there) and when I came to my new job, I have only 3 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I am learning by doing after my quick learn from digging up Ruby and Rails documentation.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2017 08:30:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/hugo-template-primer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/hugo-template-primer/</guid><description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/getting-started-with-hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/posts/getting-started-with-hugo/</guid><description>Step 1.
