If not, you are like me in early 2016, the year when I first found this gem. I was wondering about a Django since the website says &amp;ldquo;The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.&amp;rdquo; (djangoproject.com). As a person who knows nothing about Django when first read that is like, &amp;ldquo;really? I must learn this to find out this framework is really for perfectionists with deadlines or just a gimmick&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2020/05/modern-problems-require-modern-solutions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 15:37:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2020/05/modern-problems-require-modern-solutions/</guid><description>Recently I posted about my experience with the longest work from home (posted in Bahasa) I ever had so far. The biggest challenge about working from home in the internet era is the internet connection itself. I often got a bad connection in the middle of the meeting, that not good especially since I&amp;rsquo;m the host in a meeting, not only once but in &amp;ldquo;daily standup meeting&amp;rdquo;. Yes, you can see daily in the quoted word.</description></item><item><title>Playing in Ruby Mine</title><link>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2018/01/playing-in-ruby-mine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 14:39:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.muhfajar.blog/post/2018/01/playing-in-ruby-mine/</guid><description>I started as a Ruby dev in my new job, previously I worked as a PHP and Python dev and I found Ruby is slightly different sometimes, especially with PHP. The first time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional words at every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end For framework, Ruby has Rails (not only Rails actually, many frameworks out there) and when I came to my new job, I also had only 3 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I am learning by doing after my quick learn from digging up Ruby and Rails documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
