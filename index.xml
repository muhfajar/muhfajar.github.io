I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Settings</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/settings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 11:24:21 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/settings/</guid><description> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Use Bahasa &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Change font face &amp;nbsp; Increase font size &amp;nbsp; Decrease font size const buttonTextDark = 'Toggle theme to light'; const buttonTextLight = 'Toggle theme to dark'; const buttonTextTocHide = 'Show table of content'; const buttonTextTocShow = 'Hide table of content';</description></item><item><title>Chat</title><link>https://muhfajar.blog/chat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:30:21 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://muhfajar.blog/chat/</guid><description>Hello there, want to chat with stranger within this site, just open inspect and see console.

First time I read Ruby documentation, Ruby syntax is familiar, that looks like Python with some additional word every end of a function. For example:
def foo(): print(&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;) def foo puts &amp;#39;bar&amp;#39; end For framework Ruby have Rails (not only Rails actually, many framework out there) and when I came to my new job, I have only 3 days to learn what Ruby is and what is Rails, so basically I am learning by doing after my quick learn from digging up Ruby and Rails documentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
